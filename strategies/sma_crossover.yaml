# Strategy configuration file for Simple Moving Average (SMA) Crossover
#
# The idea:
#   - Calculate two moving averages of price (fast and slow).
#   - When the fast MA rises above the slow MA → BUY signal.
#   - When the fast MA falls below the slow MA → SELL signal.

# Fast MA rises above Slow MA → BUY (golden cross)

# Means the short-term price trend is stronger than the long-term trend.

# Interpreted as the market starting an upward trend.

# Fast MA falls below Slow MA → SELL (death cross)

# Means the short-term price is weakening compared to the long-term.

# Interpreted as the market entering a downward trend.
#
# This is one of the most basic "trend-following" strategies in trading.
