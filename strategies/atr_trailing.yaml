# ATR = Average True Range, a measure of volatility (how much the stock moves daily).

# Instead of exiting on a crossover or RSI, you ride the trade until price falls a certain multiple of ATR below its peak -> then SELL.

# This lets you "cut losers fast, ride winners long."


# Example

# NVDA trade enters at $500.

# ATR(14) = $12.

# Stop distance = 3 x 12 = $36.

# As price rises, we track the peak (highest price since entry).

# Say peak reaches $560.

# Stop = 560 - 36 = $524.

# If NVDA falls from 560 down to 524 -> SELL (stop hit).

# If NVDA keeps rising (say to 600), peak updates -> stop moves up to 600 - 36 = $564.
