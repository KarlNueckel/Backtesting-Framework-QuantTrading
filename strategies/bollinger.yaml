# Bollinger Bands mean-reversion strategy
#
# Idea:
#   - Middle band = moving average of the last N days.
#   - Upper/lower bands = middle Â± (num_std * standard deviation).
#   - Buy when price touches the lower band (cheap/oversold).
#   - Sell when price touches the upper band (expensive/overbought).
